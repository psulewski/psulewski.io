# About Me

I'm a PhD student at the University of Osnabr√ºck, working at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. My research focuses on understanding how the human brain solves the exploration-exploitation dilemma in visual information sampling.

## Terminal Content
Currently investigating neural mechanisms of visual attention using MEG, eye-tracking, and computational modeling. Previously worked on individual differences in visual object representations and brain-computer interfaces.
