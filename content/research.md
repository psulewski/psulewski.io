# Research Areas

## Visual Attention & Exploration
How does the brain decide where to look next? Investigating the neural dynamics of visual information sampling using MEG and eye-tracking.

## Individual Neural Variability
Understanding spatiotemporal differences in neural representations during visual object recognition across individuals.

## Brain-Computer Interfaces
Exploring attention, metacognition, and perceptual decision-making through neural feedback systems.

## Computational Modeling
Building models that bridge the gap between neural mechanisms and cognitive behavior.
